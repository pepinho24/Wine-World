      "Title": "The best 10 wines for 2016",
      "CreatedOn": "2017-01-02T21:05:27.348Z",
      "Author": "asdasd",
      "Content": "<p>Here at <strong>WineWorld</strong> we drank a lot of really great wine in 2016. Still, some bottles truly stood out, and you&rsquo;ll find the list of these below.</p>\n<p>Each wine on this list possesses one crucial quality: immediate drinkability. These wines are approachable, interesting, and, despite one or two exceptions where aging would help, ready to be popped and poured. That&rsquo;s not to say most of the bottles can&rsquo;t be aged; they can, and if you have the space and time, they should, but we recognize most people are looking for that great bottle to buy and drink on the same day. All of these bottles deliver that and more.</p>\n<p>Here are the top 10 wines of 2016 according to the <strong>WineWorld</strong> staff:</p>\n<p><strong>1. BOSCARELLI VINO NOBILE DI MONTEPULCIANO 2013, $34</strong><br />The Top 50 Wines of 2016<br />This wine is truly mind-blowing, and a prime example that Brunello is not the only Tuscan DOCG producing outstanding Sangiovese. In fact, this wine has us wondering whether Montepulciano might be the best place in Tuscany for the grape&rsquo;s cultivation. Made by a boutique family producer, this wine is a beautiful balance of fruit and earth, with bright cherries equalized by tobacco and leather. What we find truly amazing about this wine is that it is not only drinking beautifully now, but it&rsquo;s also a bottle that could be saved for years and it will only get better.</p>\n<p><strong>2. LE CIGARE VOLANT R&Eacute;SERVE 2012, $69</strong><br />The Top 50 Wines of 2016<br />Randall Grahm is a winemaker who continues to impress. His move to close all of his wines with screwcap might be seen by some people as cheapening the wines, but that couldn&rsquo;t be further from the truth. This is a serious, age-worthy red wine that showcases why Randall is one of this country&rsquo;s best winemakers. A Rhone-style red blend, the wine is deep and dark with the Syrah playing the dominant role. Flavors of dark berries marry with leather to create a delicious wine.</p>\n<p><strong>3. TABARRINI CAMPO ALLA CERQUA SAGRANTINO 2010, $50</strong><br />tabarrini<br />It&rsquo;s a rare occurrence to find a wine and winemaker both as exciting as Tabbarini. While Sagrantino may not be a grape that delivers immediately, once it&rsquo;s aged it can be one of the greatest wines in the world. This bottle is the best example coming out of Montefalco. Ageable for decades, this is a wine that is worth purchasing and holding on to; a fantastic investment.</p>\n<p><strong>4. VI&Ntilde;A REAL RESERVA 2010, $30</strong><br />The Top 50 Wines of 2016<br />Good Rioja is one of the greatest bangs for your buck in the wine world. This reserva from one of the region&rsquo;s top producers doesn&rsquo;t disappoint. The wine pours a beautiful ruby color with aromas of red cherries, vanilla, and leather. There are flavors of dark red fruit, with nice acidity and balanced tannins.</p>\n<p><strong>5. COS CONTRADA 2009, $85</strong><br />The Top 50 Wines of 2016<br />This is what opulence tastes like. This is the purest expression of Nero d&rsquo;Avola we have ever encountered. One sip and you&rsquo;ll see why so many people think this little grape from Sicily really could be the next big thing in the wine world. It&rsquo;s a truly elegant wine.</p>\n<p><strong>6. GUY BRETON MORGON &ldquo;VIEILLES VIGNES&rdquo; 2014, $31</strong><br />The Top 50 Wines of 2016<br />This bright and fruit-forward wine is a delicious example of what Gamay from Beaujolais should be. Guy Breton farms all of his vineyards organically, with only indigenous yeasts used during fermentation. The Gamay is carbonically macerated and aged on its lees, leading way to a layered palate of bright red fruit.</p>\n<p><strong>7. MULLAN ROAD CELLARS RED BLEND 2013, $44</strong><br />The Top 50 Wines of 2016<br />This Columbia Valley red blend is a stellar example of what Bordeaux blends from Washington State can do. The assemblage of 57% Cabernet Sauvignon, 34% Merlot, 8% Cabernet Franc, and a mere 1% Malbec creates a full-bodied yet utterly smooth wine, bursting with flavors of ripe blackberries and figs. Well-integrated tannins leave the wine feeling silky on the palate, with an ageing potential of up to 10 years.</p>\n<p><strong>8. GRAHAM&rsquo;S 10 YEAR TAWNY PORT, $33</strong><br />The Top 50 Wines of 2016<br />There&rsquo;s no better wine for a cold or rainy night than Graham&rsquo;s 10 Year Tawny Port. The wine is a blend of both older and younger wines, with an average age of 10 years. Older wines bring complex, layered flavors of caramel to the blend, while the younger wines bring bright fruit and zesty acidity to the mix. The result is a copper-colored wine full of nutty caramel flavors, rich and gentle on the palate, with a lasting finish.</p>\n<p><strong>9. A PORTELA MENCIA 2013, $15</strong><br />The Top 50 Wines of 2016<br />Indigenous to northwestern Spain, the Mencia grape thrives in the granite and slate soils of Galicia, specifically in the Bierzo and Valdeorras regions. A Portela Mencia comes from high-elevation vines, all tended organically, producing a bright wine with meaty yet fruit-forward characteristics. Cold soaking prior to fermentation followed by ageing in stainless steel produces this bold yet easy drinking wine that remains authentic to the true characteristics of the Mencia grape.</p>\n<p><strong>10. JIM CLENDENEN NEBBIOLO &ndash; THE PIP 2011, $30</strong><br />The Top 50 Wines of 2016<br />Yes, this is a Nebbiolo from California, and yes, you are going to love it. Made by Jim Clendenen, a winemaker who has become known for outstanding Pinot Noir under the Au Bon Climat label, this Nebbiolo has flown a bit under the radar. We think it may be one of the best wines he makes. It&rsquo;s also typical of Nebbiolo; you&rsquo;ll find aromas of roses and cherries, with deep dark fruit, bright acidity, and tannins on the palate.</p>",

      "description": "The classic profile of Cabernet Sauvignon tends to be full-bodied wines with high tannins and noticeable acidity that contributes to the wine's aging potential. In cooler climates, Cabernet Sauvignon tends to produce wines with blackcurrant notes that can be accompanied by green bell pepper notes, mint and cedar which will all become more pronounced as the wine ages. In more moderate climates the blackcurrant notes are often seen with black cherry and black olives notes while in very hot climates the currant flavors can veer towards the over-ripe and \"jammy\" side. In parts of Australia, particularly the Coonawarra wine region of South Australia, Cabernet Sauvignon wines tend to have a characteristic eucalyptus or menthol notes.",

The \"International style\" favored by many New World wine regions tends to emphasize late harvesting to gain physiological ripeness and produce inky, purple colored wines that are full in body with high alcohol and lush, velvety tannins with intense, plum and blackberry fruit. While this international style is practiced by many Bordeaux wine producers, the traditional \"Bordeaux style\" of Merlot involves harvesting Merlot earlier to maintain acidity and producing more medium-bodied wines with moderate alcohol levels that have fresh, red fruit flavors (raspberries, strawberries) and potentially leafy, vegetal notes.",
